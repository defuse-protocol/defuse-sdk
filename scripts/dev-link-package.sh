# Development hot-reload utility that overrides package files in target project.
#
# Directly updates files in node_modules instead of using yarn link to avoid:
# - Dependency duplication
# - Module resolution conflicts  
# - Package version mismatches
# Only essential files (dist/ and package.json) are linked while preserving
# the target project's dependency tree.
#
# Important Note:
# If you add new dependency to this package, you need to manually
# install (copy-paste) it to the `$target_project/node_modules`.

#
# We place this package inside other than `node_modules` folder to enable
# Hot Module Replacement (HMR) in the target project. Otherwise watchers
# ignore changes in `node_modules`.
